this is a project about me trying to put live a parody webshop.

the idea originated from me creating some custom t shirts- and now friends asked me about them and I jokingly said that I will put a webshyop online where they can order them, but here's the catch

the website is just a static one where basicall all the t shirts are sold pout.

I already have some model soots of the t shirts.

what I need next is to basically build a simple webshop website, without any official funbctionality such as a backend or w/e

the insipiration for the design and layout I want comes from https://shopndl.com/
just a simple onepager like the homepage from https://shopndl.com/

where the name of my webshop is Cems Fashion.

I want the t shirts(model shots) lined up in the same layout with a price tag and a title
and if clicked on it goes to the t shirt page I would see the sizes, some short description and then the price tag plus the button where it says sold out, which is supposed ot be the order now button.

directory should be a simple index.html file.
and a media folder where the images are stored

the websohop should have a basket funcitonality, but nothing will be able to be stored in there as everything is Ã«ssentially" sold out

make sure to make an exact copy of the stryle and layout of https://shopndl.com/
